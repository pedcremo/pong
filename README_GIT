PUPILS INFORMATION
-------------------
In case git tools is not present in your system first you should install git tool on linux "sudo apt-get install git-core" and afterwards clone PONG repository (Only do it once)

"git clone https://github.com/pedcremo/pong.git"

Synchronization in order to be project up to date changes (You should perform it every time you start every working session)

git pull https://github.com/pedcremo/pong.git

git branches
------------
v1 branch
  A simple ball could be moved in three event triggered ways. Click, double click and keypress
v2 branch
  A ball with stick bouncing recognition. We play in single player mode

STEPS TO CREATE A GITHUB REPOSITORY FROM SCRATCH
------------------------------------------------
1. We init our project folder and files locally
2. From newly createt folder root we run "git init" to create the repository.
3. Run "git add *" to add all project files to stage area (locally)
4. At every moment we can run "git status" to know what is inside repository and what not
5. We'll do 'git commit -a -m "First PONG version"' to consolidate changes on repository and we must explain with a comment why(locally)
6. We add our git setup to gitHub "git remote add origin https://github.com/pedcremo/pong.git"
7. Send our local changes to remote repo "git push -u origin master" (-u used to remmber parameters so afterwards w can only command "git push") we will be asked for github user and pass . If we connect to github webpage files will appear there.

TIP: At first it is recommended to perform a pull to synchronize remotely
"git pull https://github.com/pedcremo/scriptkana.git"

8. If you don't want to be asked at every moment for your credentials
 git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com


GIT RECOMMENDED WORKING FLOW
----------------------------
Recommended reading http://git-scm.com/book/es/Git-en-entornos-distribuidos-Flujos-de-trabajo-distribuidos


1. "git pull" every time we start a new code working session
2. "git add ." in order to add files modified in the current commit (not mandatory if we do "git commit -a -m "MESSAGE" because -a modifier adds to stage area modified files) and "git add FILE_NAME" to add new files
3.  To perform a commit always recommended "git commit -a -m 'MESSAGE'" doing a descriptive as possible message.
4. "git push" ("git push origin master" to upload changes to remote repo.

Basic reference
---------------
git status -s
first column --> shows difference between committed and staged
second column  --> shows difference between staged and unstaged


git diff --> changes between staged and unstaged
git diff --cached --> diff between committed and staged changes
git diff HEAD --> diff between committed and unstaged
--stat --> shorter summary of changes

git commit --> commits all staged changes
git commit -a --> commits all changes for all tracked files

git reset HEAD -- file-name
Unstage all staged changes for a file

git rm --> removes file from staging area and also deletes the file
git rm --cached --> removes the file from staging area but leaving it on the hard disk

git branch --> lists all branches
git branch branchname -->creates a new branch
git checkout branchname --> switch to a new branch
git checkout -b branchname --> create a new branch and shift to it
git branch -d branchname --> delete a branch

git log
git log --oneline
git log --oneline --graph
git log --oneline branch1 ^branch2 --> logs in branch1 and not in branch2

git tag -a --> add an annotated tag
git tag -a commit-SHA --> tag a specific commit

git remote --> list remotes
git remote -v --> list remotes verbosely
git remote add <remote-name> git@github.com:<username>/<reponame>.git --> add a github remote
git remote rm remote-name --> delete a remote

git fetch remote-name
git pull remote-name = git fetch + git merge
